# Automated-image-classification
This Repo is for self learning purpose and currently underdevlopment


In this project 

1) Trainning a deep learning model and saving trained deep learning model in Mongodb Local server 
2) Importing trained model from mongodb server and predict 
3) Using Predict function creating a csv with image name and save result with how much accuracy it say that it is a dog or a cat
4) saving that resuilt (.csv) file to mongodb server 
5) Now using (.csv) we will extract those predict image name whose prediction accuracy is more than 95%
6) And retrain the image classification model from server and save that model on server so that our accuarcy will increase daily or weekly basis 

7) lastly we run a mailer script so that what % accuracy of model is increased also we use mailer for any type of report
